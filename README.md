- Download the installer

- Launch the installer

- Click on `More info` and `Run anyway` if a window "Windows protected your pc" poped up (the app is safe, you can check the source code [here](https://github.com/OJddJO/osu-music-player/tree/main/osu!player))

*To disable this window: Go to **Start > Settings > Security > App and Browser Control > Reputation-based protection settings and then disable it** (the option is quite unecessary because there is something called antivirus)*
